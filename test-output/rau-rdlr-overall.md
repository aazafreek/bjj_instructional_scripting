## Introduction
The Reverse De La Riva (RDLR) guard is a dynamic and versatile position in modern jiu-jitsu. It's effective in both gi and no-gi, offering multiple attacking options including leg attacks, back takes, and sweeps. This medium-range guard has become increasingly popular due to its effectiveness in competition and defensive capabilities.

### The Hook Mechanics
- Focus on knee-to-knee alignment
