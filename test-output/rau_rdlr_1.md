# Reverse De La Riva Guard Guide

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Jason Rau, black belt under Matt Serra, and I'll be teaching about the Reverse De La Riva (RDLR) guard. This is one of my favorite guards because it offers many options - you can attack legs, take the back, or sweep to get on top. It's one of the most dynamic positions used in modern jiu-jitsu.

## Basic Concepts

### Guard Range
RDLR is considered a medium-range guard, between close guard and long-range guards. This makes it very versatile and commonly used, especially against standing opponents.

### The Hook
While the RDLR hook is part of the position, the most important aspect is knee positioning rather than the hook itself. The key points are:

- Focus on getting your knee to your opponent's knee
- This allows you to circle around and access different attacks
- The hook naturally comes as a result of proper knee positioning
- Having the inside position with your knee is crucial

### Basic Frame
The basic frame consists of:
- Elbow tight and inside opponent's knee
- Foot can be placed on shoulder or bicep
- Avoid placing foot on stomach
- Maintain control of opponent's lead leg
- Use grips on calf to control space

## Primary Attacks

### 1. Inverting with Underhook
This is the most basic but least preferred method:

1. Start with RDLR position
2. Switch from overhook to underhook on opponent's leg
3. Slide knee across to create space
4. Get underhook deep on opponent's leg
5. Invert while maintaining control
6. Come up to attacking position

### 2. Inverting with Overhook
This is the preferred method because:
- Better control of opponent's weight
- Easier to keep opponent on back leg
- More secure during inversion
- Sets up leg attacks better

Steps:
1. Grip heel with fingers wrapped around
2. Use knee to turn opponent's leg out
3. Off-balance opponent backward
4. Invert while maintaining grip
5. Come up to attacking position

## Defensive Options

When opponent gets deep into RDLR:
1. Frame with bicep against their knee
2. Keep elbows tight to body
3. Maintain closed space between elbow and knee
4. Use cross-lapel frame
5. Look for opportunities to counter

## Summary

The RDLR guard is a versatile position that offers many attacking options. Success depends on:
- Proper knee positioning
- Maintaining inside control
- Understanding distance management
- Using correct framing
- Choosing appropriate attacks based on opponent's reaction

The key is getting opponent's weight on their back leg before attempting inversions or attacks. This makes your techniques more effective and harder to counter.
