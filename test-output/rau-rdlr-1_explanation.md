## Introduction

The Reverse De La Riva (RDLR) guard is one of the most dynamic and effective open guard positions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It offers numerous attacking options including leg attacks, back takes, and sweeps. This guide will cover the fundamental principles and techniques of the position.

## Basic Position

The RDLR is considered a medium-range guard position. The key points for establishing the basic position are:

1. Your outside leg hooks behind your opponent's lead leg
2. Your inside knee should be positioned against their knee
3. Maintain control of their lead leg with grips
4. Keep your elbow tight and inside their knee
5. Your free foot can post on their hip or shoulder

## The Hook

While the hook is part of the position, the most important aspect is the knee positioning rather than the hook itself. Key details:

- Focus on getting your knee to their knee
- This allows you to circle around and attack
- The hook will naturally come as you maintain knee position
- Don't worry too much about forcing a deep hook

## Control Points

The main control points in RDLR are:

1. The knee-to-knee connection
2. Grip on the lead leg (either overhook or underhook)
3. Secondary grip options:
   - Cross lapel grip
   - Sleeve control
   - Ankle grip
4. Foot positioning on hip/shoulder

## Inverting Techniques

### Underhook Inversion
1. Establish underhook on opponent's lead leg
2. Create space with knee shield
3. Slide knee across to make room
4. Invert while maintaining leg control
5. Come up on far hip to attack

### Overhook Inversion
1. Secure deep overhook on lead leg
2. Off-balance opponent backward
3. Invert while pulling leg across body
4. Keep tight connection throughout movement
5. Come up to attacking position

### Off-Balancing to Invert
1. Use frames to create space
2. Hook behind far hamstring
3. Off-balance opponent laterally
4. Invert as they lose balance
5. Maintain leg control throughout

## Defensive Options

When opponent has strong pressure:
1. Keep elbows tight to knees
2. Use frames to maintain space
3. Look for opportunities to off-balance
4. Be ready to transition to other guards
5. Never let them separate your elbow from your knee

## Advanced Techniques

1. Lasso transitions
2. Combination attacks
3. Counter-attacks against passing attempts
4. Chain attacks together
5. Creating and maintaining angles

The key to success with RDLR is maintaining proper positioning and being ready to chain techniques together as opportunities present themselves. Focus on controlling your opponent's weight distribution and movement while keeping yourself safe.
