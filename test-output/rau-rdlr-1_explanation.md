## Introduction
The Reverse De La Riva (RDLR) guard is a dynamic position that offers multiple attacking options including leg attacks, back takes, and sweeps. It's considered a medium-range guard that works well in both gi and no-gi situations.

## Basic Position
The basic RDLR position involves:
- Your outside leg hooking behind your opponent's lead leg
- Your inside foot positioned on their hip or in their bicep
- Maintaining control of their lead leg with your arms
- Keeping your knee aligned with their knee for optimal control

## The Hook
While the hook is part of the position, the key focus should be on:
- Knee-to-knee alignment rather than just the hook
- Maintaining inside position with your knee
- Using the hook to control and off-balance your opponent
- Adapting the hook depth based on your opponent's stance

## Key Concepts
1. Frame Management:
   - Keep your elbow tight to your knee
   - Maintain strong frames to prevent passing
   - Use your forearm in the armpit for control

2. Distance Control:
   - Control the space between you and your opponent
   - Prevent them from establishing strong passing pressure
   - Use frames to maintain optimal distance

## Inversion Techniques

### Underhook Inversion
1. From RDLR position, secure an underhook on opponent's leg
2. Create space by sliding your knee through
3. Lift hips off the mat
4. Invert while maintaining leg control
5. Come up on your side to complete the move

### Overhook Inversion
1. Maintain overhook control on opponent's leg
2. Grip their heel with fingers wrapped around
3. Use your knee to turn their leg outward
4. Off-balance them backward
5. Invert while maintaining control

### Standing vs Kneeling
- Standing opponent: Focus on breaking their posture first
- Kneeling opponent: Easier to execute inversions
- Adjust grips and control based on opponent's position

## Defensive Options
When caught in tight pressure:
1. Frame with elbows close to knees
2. Keep bicep connected to inner thigh
3. Maintain closed space between elbow and knee
4. Use cross-lapel grip for additional control
5. Look for opportunities to re-establish position

## Advanced Concepts
1. Off-balancing:
   - Use knee position to break opponent's balance
   - Create space for inversions and attacks
   - Combine with grips for maximum effect

2. Transitional Movement:
   - Flow between different variations
   - Chain attacks together
   - Maintain constant pressure and control
